# Overview
Trying to create an index of great deep learning resources.

### Good Resources
- https://modelzoo.co/ - a great collection of pretrained models and instructions for implementing them in various DL libraries

### Optimization Algorithms:
- http://www.fast.ai/2018/07/02/adam-weight-decay/

### learning keras
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/keras-functional-api-deep-learning/

### Feature Engineering 
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/books-on-data-cleaning-data-preparation-and-feature-engineering/

### Algorithms
- linear regression
- logistic regression
- support vector machines
- random forest
- gradient boosting machines
- neural network

### Concepts
- precision vs recall
- PCA, eigenvalues
- r-squared
- k-nearest-neighbors vs k-means

### Statistical tests
- 

### Other 
- Lagrangians
- r squared


### Good books
- Coding the Matrix
